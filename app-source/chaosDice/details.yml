short_description: A dice rolling app

description: |
  This dice app lets you roll a digital die (2,4,6,8,10,12,20, or 100 sides).   
  The app uses the built in ADC's to generate a long random seed (which is displayed as an animation when you roll) and uses some simple math to convert it into a true random number within your chosen die range.  
  Results have been tested casually (500000 rolls visualized in a histogram, for each die type) and the rolls appear to be pretty uniform in distribution.

installation_instructions: |
  Copy the app into your `/apps` folder.
