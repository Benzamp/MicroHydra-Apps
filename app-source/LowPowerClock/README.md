<br/>

This is another simple clock app. This time, the app has been specifically designed to use as little power as possible.   
The app runs at a cpu frequency of 40mhz (rather than the official top freq of 240mhz), gently lowers to a really low display brightness when no keys are pressed, and puts the device into deep sleep mode after some time (and can be woken up with G0)
